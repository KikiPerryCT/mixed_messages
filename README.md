# Codecademy: Mixed Messages Generator
This project is part of the [Codecademy fullstack course portfolio project](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-javascript-syntax-portfolio-project/modules/fscp-mixed-messages/kanban_projects/mixed-messages). The objective of this project is to generate random messages using Javascript. In my project, the program will randomly select from 3 quote topics (life, love and friendship) and display a quote from the selected quote topic.

## Technologies
* Javascript

## Setup
1. Download the code
2. Unzip and run the code: `node main.js` 

*Make sure you have node installed!*

## Features
You can choose to add additional quotes to either life, love, or friendship via the following command:
`quotes.life = 'This is a quote i am adding to life';`


Replace `quotes.life` with either `quotes.life`, `quotes.love`, or `quotes.friendship` and your desired quote within the quotation marks.
You can verify that the quote is added to the respective quote topic by using `console.log(quotes.life)`

## Status
Project is finished
